# Final-Project
Rock, Paper, Scissors




# Statement: <h1> 
In this project I set out to create a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors that involved audio and images. I choose to use Audio to make the game experience more enjoyable and also learn how audio and JavaScript work together. The images add a nice artistic take on the game and make the program more enjoyable then just looking at words. I took an HTML approach for uploading images which helped me learn some of the basic intertwining of java script and HTML.

# Analysis: <h1> 
  I used the preload function which allowed me to upload my external audio files before any other functions were executed. I also used a document object which represents the HTML document that is displayed in the window. This allowed access to the modification of the document content because a Document object has properties that refer to other objects. I also used an array of values that the program would randomly select to give me the programs choice for the game.
