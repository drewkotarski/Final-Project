# Final-Project
Rock, Paper, Scissors




# Statement <h1> 
In this project I set out to create a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors that involved audio and images. I choose to use Audio to make the game experience more enjoyable and also learn how audio and JavaScript work together. The images add a nice artistic take on the game and make the program more enjoyable then just looking at words. I took an HTML approach for uploading images which helped me learn some of the basic intertwining of java script and HTML.
